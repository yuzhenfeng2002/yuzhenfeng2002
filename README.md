### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently a Ph.D. student in Transportation at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am interested in (1) elegant mathematical models to describe human behaviors in transport systems; and (2) effective operations research tools to improve the performance of transport systems.
