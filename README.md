# Hi there, I'm Yuzhen 👋

- I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
- I am interested in developing and employing operations research tools, including *network modeling, optimization, and equilibrium*, to understand and enhance existing transportation systems.
- I have been striving to understand the world and make a difference. My initial motivation for pursuing operations research is to achieve the latter. Transportation serves as a microcosm for understanding the world.
